An introduction to basic computer hardware, machine language, assembly language, and C programming. 
<!--more-->
### [Project 1](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw01)

This assignment is divided into three parts: "Part 1 - Bitvector" focuses on implementing operations on a 32-bit data structure representing a bit vector, "Part 2 - Bases" involves converting between different number bases using bitwise operators, and "Part 3 - Operations" includes tasks related to various bitwise and arithmetic operations. 
***
### [Project 2](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw02)

The purpose of this assignment is to develop proficiency in building digital logic circuits, progressing from transistors to gates and ultimately constructing an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Circuitsim. The tasks involve creating standard logic gates, an 8-input multiplexer, a decoder, a 1-bit full adder, and an 8-bit full adder, with the final goal of assembling a functional ALU capable of performing specified mathematical and logical operations.
***
### [Project 3](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw03)

The purpose of this assignment is to develop an understanding of registers, state machines, and K-maps.
***
### [Project 4](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw04)

The purpose of this assignment is to understand the datapath and state machine of LC-3, and the microcode that controls the state machine.
***

### [Project 5](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw05)

This assignment aims to familiarize individuals with programming in LC-3 assembly code, encompassing tasks such as writing small programs, translating conditionals and loops, modifying memory, manipulating strings, and converting high-level programs into assembly code.
***

### [Project 6](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw06)

This assignment aims to familiarize with the Stack and Calling Convention in LC-3 Assembly by requiring the implementation of four subroutines (gcd.asm, sort.asm, reverseCopy.asm) in LC-3 assembly language. Through this process, students are expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of the LC-3 Calling Convention, Stack Frame, and the implementation of subroutines in assembly language, including recursion.
***

### [Project 7](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw07)

The purpose of this assignment focuses on handling structs, pointers, pointer arithmetic, arrays, strings, and macros. It defines functions to manipulate an array of hogwarts_student structs, including adding students with specific constraints, updating student names, swapping students' positions, removing students, comparing names based on ASCII values, sorting students based on the last three characters of their names, and printing the student details. 
***

### [Project 9](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw09)
The purpose of this assignment is to introduce dynamic memory allocation in C by implementing a singly-linked list data structure.
