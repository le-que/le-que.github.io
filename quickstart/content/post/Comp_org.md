### [Project 1](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw01)

This assignment is divided into three parts: "Part 1 - Bitvector" focuses on implementing operations on a 32-bit data structure representing a bit vector, "Part 2 - Bases" involves converting between different number bases using bitwise operators, and "Part 3 - Operations" includes tasks related to various bitwise and arithmetic operations.

### [Project 2](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw02)

The purpose of this assignment is to develop proficiency in building digital logic circuits, progressing from transistors to gates and ultimately constructing an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Circuitsim. The tasks involve creating standard logic gates, an 8-input multiplexer, a decoder, a 1-bit full adder, and an 8-bit full adder, with the final goal of assembling a functional ALU capable of performing specified mathematical and logical operations.
***
### [Project 3](https://github.com/le-que/Computer-Organization/tree/main/hw03)

The purpose of this assignment is to develop an understanding of registers, state machines, and K-maps.
***
### [Project 4]()

The purpose of this assignment is to understand the datapath and state machine of LC-3, and the microcode that controls the state machine.
